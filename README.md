List of all my projects (Dated: 29-03-2021)


# Captcha Reader + Web Scraper (colab Notebook(private), an image as proof)

This project was done by me in colaboration with Ritik Alwani (a collegue from NIT Surat), which though having enough potential is left in mid progress. This project had an aim to automate the scraping for **indian government websites** with just login credentials, output type as input, and the client could get the required outputs through the scraper. This was done to reduce the client efforts for searching through various websites for their current status, which can be sometimes a very tedius job.

Though, if anyone gets interested in this project, we have already acheived some milestones, and would love to work on a partnership.

# Expenses Application (Published on Client Play store Developer Account)

This application is published on the FIRMSAP developer account as Legully Expenses App, and is majorly an application to manage the user's expense documents.  This was a freelancer project, and was a great experience for me, and it involves the use of Google sheets API, the oauth 2.0 consent screen, and filtering and sorting data based on tags.

# Equestock (Mobile Application: Play Store Published, Web Application: Firebase Published)

Equestock is an application which provides a detailed stock analysis, for newbies and professionals along with live financial articles from popular news websites.
There are sections for most active and most gainer stocks with  detailed descriptions and suggestions on buying the stock based on the live market conditions.

This application couldn't be completed without the help of my friend Saiyam Bhatnagar, whose expertise in Stock Market Analysis helped us to filter out every last detail in companies financials.
The average retail investor with a Robinhood account and a few thousand dollars obviously does not have access to the sophisticated FinTech machines employed by big firms and institutional investors. A retail investor is likely to never own a Bloomberg Terminal, thus being left to scour the web for sources from articles, or rumors from message boards. 

Equestock levels the playing field. The point of Equestock is to act as a poor manâ€™s Bloomberg Terminal, with just as prudent data. Through our  proprietary algorithms, web scrapers, and machine learning, Equestock is able to be an incredibly powerful sentiment analyzer. 

With millions of different conversations occurring simultaneously over the globe, and many of these conversations taking place on online public forums gives Equestock the opportunity to mine this public data for better sentiment analysis. There is no way for one person to single-handedly parse through all of this data on their own, or even with a team of people. 

Because of the problem of too much data, financial institutions have employed similar technical applications on Wall Street to assist in their stock trading. These financial tools are almost impossible to get access to as a normal retail investor.

Equestock is a sentiment analyzer to save you time when reviewing stocks. Articles, technical analysis, and sentiment analysis are all delivered to you through the app.

# Virtual Try-On (Colab Notebook: Python)
A virtual try-on method takes a product image and an image of a model and produces an image of the model wearing the product. Most methods essentially compute warps from the product image to the model image and combine using image generation methods. However, obtaining a realistic image is challenging because the kinematics of garments is complex and because outline, texture, and shading cues in the image reveal errors to human viewers. The garment must have appropriate drapes; texture must be warped to be consistent with the shape of a draped garment; small details (buttons, collars, lapels, pockets, etc.) must be placed appropriately on the garment, and so on. Evaluation is particularly difficult and is usually qualitative.
