# Invoices Parser App (Web App published on Firebase)
Invoices Parser is a web application I am currently working on, which uses Google Cloud Document AI Processor for Invoices Parsing, and the parsed information gets stored in Firebase Cloud, and the outputs can be exported to google sheets, which is integrated through the sheet API. The app has 3 user roles, superadmin, admin and employees.


This application has accounting firms as their primary customers and invoices can be allotted to employees from the admin. The app has a separate superadmin panel to keep check on usage.


The application is currently in MVP Phase, and a lot of new features are supposed to be added. The funding is under Mudit Goyal, CEO of FIRMSAP VENTURES, and the sole development is under my control.

# Captcha Reader + Web Scraper (colab Notebook(private))

This project was done by me in colaboration with Ritik Alwani (a collegue from NIT Surat), which though having enough potential is left in mid progress. This project had an aim to automate the scraping for **indian government websites** with just login credentials, output type as input, and the client could get the required outputs through the scraper. This was done to reduce the client efforts for searching through various websites for their current status, which can be sometimes a very tedius job.

# Equestock (Mobile Application, Web Application: Firebase Published)

Equestock is an application which provides a detailed stock analysis, for newbies and professionals along with live financial articles from popular news websites.
There are sections for most active and most gainer stocks with  detailed descriptions and suggestions on buying the stock based on the live market conditions.

This application couldn't be completed without the help of my friend Saiyam Bhatnagar, whose expertise in Stock Market Analysis helped us to filter out every last detail in companies financials.
The average retail investor with a Robinhood account and a few thousand dollars obviously does not have access to the sophisticated FinTech machines employed by big firms and institutional investors. A retail investor is likely to never own a Bloomberg Terminal, thus being left to scour the web for sources from articles, or rumors from message boards. 

Equestock levels the playing field. The point of Equestock is to act as a poor manâ€™s Bloomberg Terminal, with just as prudent data. Through our  proprietary algorithms, web scrapers, and machine learning, Equestock is able to be an incredibly powerful sentiment analyzer. 

With millions of different conversations occurring simultaneously over the globe, and many of these conversations taking place on online public forums gives Equestock the opportunity to mine this public data for better sentiment analysis. There is no way for one person to single-handedly parse through all of this data on their own, or even with a team of people. 

Because of the problem of too much data, financial institutions have employed similar technical applications on Wall Street to assist in their stock trading. These financial tools are almost impossible to get access to as a normal retail investor.

Equestock is a sentiment analyzer to save you time when reviewing stocks. Articles, technical analysis, and sentiment analysis are all delivered to you through the app.

# Virtual Try-On (Colab Notebook: Python)
A virtual try-on method takes a product image and an image of a model and produces an image of the model wearing the product. Most methods essentially compute warps from the product image to the model image and combine using image generation methods. However, obtaining a realistic image is challenging because the kinematics of garments is complex and because outline, texture, and shading cues in the image reveal errors to human viewers. The garment must have appropriate drapes; texture must be warped to be consistent with the shape of a draped garment; small details (buttons, collars, lapels, pockets, etc.) must be placed appropriately on the garment, and so on. Evaluation is particularly difficult and is usually qualitative.
